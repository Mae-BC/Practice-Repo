/// file-1 contents

This is the first file for my pratice repo. I am practicing pull requests, branching, merging and pushhing repos on to github via console commands.

Commit 2


Commit 3 :)

////file-2M contents

This is the second file for my master branch. I sucessfully pushed my master branch and branch one onto github using the command line.  
I keep forgetting the command for switching branches. "checkout" Im trying to think of an analogy to remind me. Unsuccessful so far. 
Next goal is up loading next commit to the master branch via this file. I wonder if I can merge this file with file-1 via command line. I will experiment :)

/// conlusion

Instead of trying to merge 2 seperate files i decided to make a new branch and manually make a file. I think i need to nail the basics before i start fucking around with more complicated stuff like that. 

-Reflection.

This was fun and straight foward once I wrapped my head around it. It took a couple tries to push from my local files to the remote ones. I think it was because I set the remote repo as privite although im not 100% sure. It started working after i changed it to public. also the commandline created what looked like a different branch called origin/master which i could only see when running the log --all --graph command. unsure what that is or what it does. I assume it had something to do with how i pushed my repo to github. unsure if that would cause problems or not.
