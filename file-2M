This is the second file for my master branch. I sucessfully pushed my master branch and branch one onto github using the command line.  
I keep forgetting the command for switching branches. "checkout" Im trying to think of an analogy to remind me. Unsuccessful so far. 
Next goal is up loading next commit to the master branch via this file. I wonder if I can merge this file with file-1 via command line. I will experiment :)
